# med-image-project

The main aim of this project is to implement a Convolutional Neural Network to classify X-Ray images in order to determine if a given radiograph is said to have pneumonia or not. Due to the ambiguous nature of Neural Networks, it's not fully understood the reasons behind why they choose to classify images in a certain way. Because of this, I've decided to analyse the model outputs at different depths of the network. Further to this, it would be advantaegous to gain some insight into the features that the model is learning, in order to visualise what may constitute a diagnosis of pneumonia. This will be done by visualising both the input images and the respective 'learned' features by examining the respective Convolutional Layer outputs.
